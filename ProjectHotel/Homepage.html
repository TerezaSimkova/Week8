            <b>Borgo Egnazia</b> is located in Savelletri di Fasano, where the hills of the Itria Valley gently fall away to the Adriatic Sea, and the property itself is inspired by the shapes, materials and colours of a typical Puglian village. This authenticity was conceived to bring a fresh and original feel that is found ‘nowhere else’, alongside impeccable service.

            It is a miniature world of homemade breakfasts prepared by Puglian Massaie, delicious food experiences both gourmet and traditional that are strongly related to the Mediterranean Diet and then Vair, the poetic Puglian Spa, two beautiful private beaches (Cala Masciola and La Fonte) and the scenic San Domenico Golf surrounded by ancient olive trees with views that stretch to the sea. And then there’s the service; tailored, friendly and caring, a dedicated team always available to guests (the Local Advisers).

            All year round, in every season, Borgo Egnazia embodies a different concept of hospitality and wellbeing based on local, authentic experiences in the incomparable beauty of the Puglian countryside.
